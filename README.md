# GSoC18
Google Summer of Code'18. Open Food Facts : Brands/Label Detection.

This project is about detecting Brands/Labels of food product images for Open Food Facts app in real-time using Computer Vision and Deep Learning Techniques.

This repo contains the following files:

1. GSoC.m : MATLAB script to detect upper bodies in Big Bang Theory images using SVM (For temporary purpose, would train this on Open Food Facts dataset given its annotated images).

2. dataset_example.png : Example image of some training samples along with their annotated bounding boxes.

3. 2018-04-18.png : Screenshot of the current training and validation accuracy. (Improving it further by tuning the hyperparameters).
